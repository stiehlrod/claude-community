## Best Practices for Dharma Talks

### What makes good clips:

- Emotional moments (stories, realizations)
- Practical advice (actionable steps)
- Universal themes (love, loss, meaning)
- Strong opening hooks

### Optimize your recordings:
- Good audio quality is crucial (captions need clear speech)
- Well-lit face if on camera
- Minimize background noise
- Natural pauses between topics help AI find clean cut points

### Suggested posting schedule:
- 1 hour talk = 10-15 good clips
- Post 1-2 clips per day
- Spread across 1-2 weeks
- Repurpose across multiple platforms
