## How to Use These Questions

1. **Match the energy** - Read the room. Don't jump to Level 4 at a casual happy hour.
2. **Go first** - Share your own answer to invite openness.
3. **Listen actively** - The question is just the door; their answer is the room.
4. **Follow up** - "Tell me more about that" beats moving to the next question.
5. **Be reciprocal** - Alternate who answers. Connection is two-way.
